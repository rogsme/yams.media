summary: A brief summary on what YAMS is and its features
---

YAMS is a is a **highly opinionated** media server.

With YAMS you'll be able to automate your media gathering, organization and consumption.

## First, why?

I wanted a setup that my non technical girlfiend could use without any problems, so I started designing my media server using multiple open source projects, and running them on top of docker.

Fast forward two years and I would like to say it works very well ðŸ˜Ž And most importantly, I acomplished my goal: My girlfiend uses it very regularly and I've even expanded it to my Mother, who lives 5000kms from me.

My friends wanted to have a media server like mine, but it was always hard to explain everything that was involved in building and connecting all the pieces together.

So basically, my friends pushed me to build this script and documentation, so they (and now anyone!) could build it on their own homeservers.

## Features

In no particular order:

- **Automatic shows/movies download:** Just add your shows and movies to the watch list and it should automatically download the files as soon as they are available.
- **Automatic clasification and organization:** Your media files should be completely organized by default.
- **Automatic subtitles download:** Self explanatory. Your media server should automatically download subtitles in the languages you choose, if they are available.
- **Support for Web, Android, iOS, Android TV and whatever that can support Emby:** Since we are leveraging from Emby, you should be able to watch your favorite media almost anywhere.
