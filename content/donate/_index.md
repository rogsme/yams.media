## External donations (preferred)
If you **really** wish to donate, first I would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Second, I would prefer you donate to any of the projects used in this script. They are the ones doing the real work, I just created a `docker-compose` file, a couple of bash scripts, and a documentation.

Just let them know YAMS sent you there üòé

## Donations to YAMS
If you **really REALLY** want to donate to YAMS, you can donate here, but **only after you donate to one of the other projects!** 

I'm not doing this for the money, and thank God I don't need donations to keep this project up and running. This is just a fun project I did for me and my friends üòÄ
