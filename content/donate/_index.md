## External donations (preferred)
If you **really** wish to donate, first I would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Second, I would prefer you donate to any of the projects used in this script. They are the ones doing the real work, I just created a `docker-compose` file, a couple of bash scripts and a documentation.

- [linuxserver.io donations page](https://www.linuxserver.io/donate).
- [Sonarr donations page](https://sonarr.tv/donate).
- [Radarr donations page](https://radarr.video/donate).
- [Emby premier page](https://emby.media/premiere.html) (Recommended! I personally use this service).
- [qBittorrent donations page](https://www.qbittorrent.org/donate).
- [Bazarr donations page](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=XHHRWXT9YB7WE&source=url).
- [gluetun donations page](https://www.paypal.me/qmcgaw).
- Jackett does not have a donation page ü§î

Just let them know YAMS sent you there üòé

## Donations to YAMS
If you **really REALLY** want to donate to YAMS, you can donate here, but **only after you donate to one of the other projects!** 

I'm not doing this for the money, and thank God I don't need donations to keep this project up and running. This is just a fun project I did for me and my friends üòÄ
