# What is Plex?

From their [website](https://www.plex.tv/):

> With our free app you can add, access, and share all the entertainment that matters to you, on almost any deviceâ€”including your own personal media collection. Guess that makes us the hardest working app in show business.

In YAMS, Plex is going to be your streaming service powerhouse! ðŸŒŸ It's like having your own Netflix, but with way more control. Plus, sharing with friends and family is super easy!

**Note:** Be warned that Plex has [recently](https://www.plex.tv/blog/important-2025-plex-updates/) put its most basic features behind a monthly subscription or a single lifetime purchase.

## First steps

Before we dive in, we need to do a bit of setup magic to let Plex work its charms. First, stop YAMS:

```bash
$ yams stop
```

Now, let's allow your IP range to access Plex. Head to your Plex config folder (I'm assuming your install location is `/opt/yams` - adjust if you used a different path):

```bash
$ cd /opt/yams/config/plex/Library/Application\ Support/Plex\ Media\ Server/
```

Inside that folder, we need to edit `Preferences.xml`:

```bash
$ vim Preferences.xml
```
(Don't worry if you're not a vim fan - `nano` works just fine too! ðŸ˜‰)

Add this line right after the `<Preferences` part:

```xml
<Preferences allowedNetworks="<your_subnet_IP>/255.255.255.0" ...
```

The `...` means "leave the rest of the file as is" - we're just adding the `allowedNetworks` bit.

### How do you find your subnet IP? ðŸ¤”

It usually follows these patterns:
- If your server IP is `192.168.0.100`, your subnet is `192.168.0.0`
- If your server IP is `10.0.0.25`, your subnet is `10.0.0.0`

Time to restart YAMS:

```bash
$ yams restart
```

Let's check if everything's working:

```bash
$ docker logs plex
```

If you see something like:

```bash
Failed to load preferences at /config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml
Failed to load preferences at /config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml
```

It means your `Preferences.xml` needs some fixing - double-check the format and try again!

## Initial configuration

In your browser, go to [http://{your-ip-address}:32400/web]() and you'll see Plex's setup page. Click "Got it!" to get started.

**Important Note:** Unlike other YAMS services, Plex requires the "/web" path after the port number. If you just go to port 32400 without "/web", you'll see an XML file instead of the web interface.
