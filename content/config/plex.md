# What is Plex?

From their [website](https://www.plex.tv/):

> With our free app you can add, access, and share all the entertainment that matters to you, on almost any deviceâ€”including your own personal media collection. Guess that makes us the hardest working app in show business.

On YAMS, Plex is one of the most important parts: Plex is going to be your "Netflix", "Hulu" or "Amazon Prime". This means you'll be able to stream your TV shows and movies to any device using Plex.

## First steps

To start, you need to allow your IP range to access the Plex setup. In your server, first stop YAMS.

```bash
$ yams stop
```

Now, go to your Plex config in YAMS. For the purposes of this tutorial, I'm asuming your install location is `/opt/yams`.

```bash
$ cd /opt/yams/config/plex/Library/Application\ Support/Plex\ Media\ Server/
```

Inside that folder, open `Preferences.xml`.

```bash
/opt/yams/config/plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server$ vim Preferences.xml
```
(you don't have to use `vim`, you can use `nano` if you want to).

On the `Preferences.xml` file, add the following **after** the `<Preferences ` directive:

```xml
<Preferences allowedNetworks="<your_subnet_IP>/255.255.255.0" ...
```

The `...` is the rest of the XML file, you only have to add the `allowedNetworks` directive.

### How do you find your subnet IP?

This depends on your network configuration, but it _sometimes_ goes with the following rules:
- If your server IP is `192.168.0.100`, your subnet is `192.168.0.0`.
- If your server IP is `10.0.0.25`, your subnet is `10.0.0.0`.

Finally, restart YAMS.

```bash
$ yams restart
```

To check if everything is working, you can try by running:

```bash
$ docker logs plex
```

If you see something like this:

```bash
Failed to load preferences at /config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml
Failed to load preferences at /config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml
```

It means your `Preferences.xml` is badly formatted. Try to fix it and try again.

Once you finish the Preferences config, you can continue.

## Initial configuration
