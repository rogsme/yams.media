# What should YOU do now?

Everything is working now! Yay! 🎉

Here are some cool ways to make your YAMS experience even better:

### Add more indexers! 🔍
Check out the [Prowlarr indexers guide](/config/prowlarr/#indexers). The more indexers you have, the easier it'll be to find those hard-to-get movies and TV shows that your friends keep talking about!

### Expand your subtitle collection! 🗣️
Head to the [Bazarr providers guide](/config/bazarr/#providers) and add more subtitle sources. The more providers you have, the better chance Bazarr has of finding perfect subtitles for everything in your library.

### Get those apps! 📱
Install your media service apps (Emby/Jellyfin/Plex) on all your devices! They're available for:
- Android TV
- Amazon Fire TV
- Chromecast
- Roku
- Xbox
- Home Theater PCs
- And lots more!

### Consider going premium! ⭐
If you're using Emby, think about trying [Emby Premiere](https://emby.media/premiere.html). It's totally optional, but VERY recommended! You'll get:
- Offline media support
- Hardware transcoding (smoother playback!)
- Automatic content conversion
- And tons more cool features

I actually canceled all my streaming services, bought a 1-year license, and never looked back! 

### Make it yours! 🛠️
Take time to configure and fine-tune all the services. Don't worry about breaking things - you can always refer back to this documentation if something goes wrong. The best media server is one that's customized to how YOU want to use it!

Remember: A good media server should adapt to you, not the other way around! 😎
