## Common `docker` permission errors

If you are getting errors like this when running the installer or running the `yams` cli:

```sh
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock:
```

It might mean that you need to reload your user. This is fixed by logging out of your server and logging back in.

This happens because your user needs to be part of the `docker` group in order to be able to execute `docker` without `sudo`
