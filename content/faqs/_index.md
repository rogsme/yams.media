## I don't want to configure YAMS manually, is there a pre-made configuration?

Yes, but **I do not recommend using this option if this is the first time you configure YAMS.** You can check the instructions here: [Easy mode](/config/easy-mode).

## Why did you choose <this_software> instead of <that_software>?

Because. That's why it's _**opinionated**_, you don't _necessarily_ have to agree with me. This setup is aimed at noobs and first time media server enthusiasts. You can always use my sources and fork the project ðŸ”¥

## I want to use YAMS in Windows. Can I do that?

You might have success running YAMS manually in Windows with `docker`, but I recommend you check out [WIMPS](https://github.com/Xaque8787/WIMPS), a YAMS inspired setup for Windows. According to its developer [/u/zachfive87](https://www.reddit.com/user/zachfive87/), "WIMPS isn't a finished project and is very rough around the edges" but you'll might have more success running WIMPS in Windows.

## YAMS's configuration is too basic. I want more!

And you shall receive! If you want a more deep configuration, I strongly recommend you checking out [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/). The configurations there are extensive and very specific, I strongly recommend them!
