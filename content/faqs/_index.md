## I don't want to configure YAMS manually, is there a pre-made configuration?

Yes, but **I do not recommend using this option if this is the first time you configure YAMS.** You can check the instructions here: [Easy mode](/config/easy-mode).

## Why did you choose <this_software> instead of <that_software>?

Because. That's why it's _**opinionated**_, you don't _necessarily_ have to agree with me. This setup is aimed at noobs and first time media server enthusiasts. You can always use my sources and fork the project ðŸ”¥
