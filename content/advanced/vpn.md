# Keeping Your Downloads Private 🔒

Let's talk about VPNs! While they might seem like an optional extra, **you should always use a VPN when downloading torrents**. It's not just about privacy - it's about keeping you safe and sound on the internet! 

YAMS uses [gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) to manage VPN connections. It's like a super-smart traffic controller for your downloads! 🚦

## Supported VPN Providers 🌐

YAMS works with tons of VPN providers! Here's the full list, with direct links to their setup guides:

Want to use a different VPN? You can set up a [custom VPN provider](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/blob/main/setup/providers/custom.md), but keep in mind this isn't officially supported by YAMS. You'll be in DIY territory! 🛠️

## Manual Configuration 🔧

Let's walk through setting up your VPN manually. For this guide, I'll assume your YAMS is installed in `/opt/yams` - adjust the paths if you installed it somewhere else!

### Step 1: Stop YAMS
```bash
yams stop
```

### Step 2: Configure Your VPN Settings
Open your `.env` file:
```bash
nano /opt/yams/.env
```

Find the VPN section and update it:
```bash
# VPN configuration
VPN_ENABLED=y
VPN_SERVICE=protonvpn     # Your VPN service from the list above
VPN_USER=your-username    # Your VPN username
VPN_PASSWORD=your-pass    # Your VPN password
```

### Step 3: Update Docker Compose
Open `docker-compose.yaml`:
```bash
nano /opt/yams/docker-compose.yaml
```

Find the qBittorrent section and make these changes:
```yaml
  qbittorrent:
    # ports:     # Comment out these lines
    #  - 8081:8081
    network_mode: "service:gluetun"  # Uncomment this line
```

Find the SABnzbd section and make similar changes:
```yaml
  sabnzbd:
    # ports:     # Comment out these lines
    # - 8080:8080
    network_mode: "service:gluetun"  # Uncomment this line
```

At the bottom, find the gluetun section and uncomment these ports:
```yaml
  gluetun:
    ports:
      - 8080:8080/tcp  # Uncomment this line
      - 8081:8081/tcp  # Uncomment this line
```

### Step 4: Restart and Test
```bash
yams restart
```

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works
```bash
yams check-vpn
```

You should see something like:
```bash
Getting your qBittorrent IP...
<qbittorrent_ip>
Your country in qBittorrent is Brazil

Getting your IP...
<your_local_ip>
Your local IP country is North Korea

Your IPs are different. qBittorrent is working as expected! ✅
```

If you get an error, double-check all your settings and make sure they're correct!

## Pro Tips 🎯

1. **Regular Checks**: Run `yams check-vpn` periodically to make sure your VPN is working correctly
2. **Kill Switch**: YAMS automatically includes a kill switch - if the VPN goes down, your downloads stop too!
3. **Speed Matters**: Choose a VPN server that's relatively close to you for better download speeds
4. **Port Problems**: If you can't access qBittorrent after setting up the VPN, check the troubleshooting section below

## Switching to WireGuard ⚡

By default, YAMS uses **OpenVPN** for Gluetun. But if your VPN provider supports it, you can switch to **WireGuard** for faster speeds and quicker connections.

We recommend ProtonVPN for this, and we’ve written a full guide to help you switch:

👉 [Switching Gluetun to WireGuard](/advanced/wireguard/)

> 💡 If you store your WireGuard private key in the `.env` file, make sure to read the [Environment File Guide](/advanced/env-file/) to learn how to manage secrets securely.

## ProtonVPN Free Tier 🆓

If you're using a **free ProtonVPN account**, there are a few important things to know:

1.  **No Port Forwarding**: ProtonVPN's free tier does **not** support port forwarding. This means you cannot use `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING=on` or append `+pmp` to your username. The YAMS installer will automatically disable port forwarding if you select ProtonVPN and indicate you are using the free tier.
2.  **Specific Gluetun Configuration**: To ensure Gluetun connects to the free servers, you need to set the `FREE_ONLY` environment variable to `on` in your `gluetun` service configuration.

Here's how your `gluetun` service in `docker-compose.yaml` should look for a free ProtonVPN account (assuming OpenVPN, which is the default for free tier):

```yaml
  gluetun:
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun:v3
    container_name: gluetun
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    devices:
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
    ports:
      - 8888:8888/tcp # HTTP proxy
      - 8388:8388/tcp # Shadowsocks
      - 8388:8388/udp # Shadowsocks
      - 8003:8000/tcp # Admin
      - 8080:8080/tcp # gluetun 
      - 8081:8081/tcp # gluetun
    environment:
      - VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=protonvpn
      - VPN_TYPE=openvpn
      - OPENVPN_USER=${VPN_USER}
      - OPENVPN_PASSWORD=${VPN_PASSWORD}
      - OPENVPN_CIPHERS=AES-256-GCM
      - FREE_ONLY=on # <--- Add this line for free tier
      #- PORT_FORWARD_ONLY=on # <--- Comment out or remove this line
      #- VPN_PORT_FORWARDING=on # <--- Comment out or remove this line
      - FIREWALL_OUTBOUND_SUBNETS=172.60.0.0/24
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      yams_network:
        ipv4_address: 172.60.0.18
```

**Important**: If you are using the free tier, you will **not** be able to use port forwarding. This means some torrenting features (like being a seed for others) might be limited.

For more details on ProtonVPN's free tier and Gluetun, refer to the [gluetun ProtonVPN documentation](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/blob/main/setup/providers/protonvpn.md).

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues:

1. **Can't access qBittorrent:**
   - Check gluetun logs: `docker logs gluetun`
   - Verify your VPN credentials
   - Make sure ports are configured correctly

2. **VPN keeps disconnecting:**
   - Try a different VPN server
   - Check your internet connection
   - Review the gluetun logs for errors

3. **Slow speeds:**
   - Try a server closer to your location
   - Check if your VPN provider throttles P2P traffic
   - Some providers have specialized servers for torrenting - try those!
